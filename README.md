The first program for PC and smartphone dedicated to women that is not a video game.

It is used to break the ice during an interpersonal relationship, i.e. to approach.

I would like to point out that this app is the subject of a campaign by Google for the independence (not promuiscuity) of women, even going so far as to modify its translation algorithm of the play store pages to obtain a perfect translation, so I refer you to your country's play store to read the demonstration of the algorithm.
